Special thanks to Jesse La Grew [https://isc.sans.edu/handler_list.html#jesse-lagrew] for assistance with DShield settings, log retention 
and some other ideas and inspiration along the way.  I'm fairly certain at some point I borrowed something from Dr. Johannes Ullrich's 
post over at [https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield/blob/main/docs/install-instructions/AWS.md]
