## Logs in several formats will be downloaded and saved here for analysis.
A subdirectory matching each of your sensor names is required.  I'm working on creating these during Azure deployment.

Mine, for example, look like this:

```
logs/
├── africa
├── australia
├── eastasia
├── eastus
├── europe
├── india
├── israel
├── korea
├── southamerica
├── southeastasia
└── westus
```
