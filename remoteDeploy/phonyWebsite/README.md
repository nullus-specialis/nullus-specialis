### This Directory:
Contains scipt "randomImage.bash" and directory "fakeHUD".

"fakeHUD" contains a rudimentary html site with a world map image and an image map overlay.

The bash script is intended to execute via cron every 60 seconds. The script overwrites worldMap.jpg in the webroot with one of six alternates in the images directory.

index.html also contains a refresh of 60 seconds.

Hot URL links in the image map point to "nobody.html", which is a gag on "nullus specialis", which then redirects to Google Translate for the Latin to English.
